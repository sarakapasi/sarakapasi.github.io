This is SEA's pilot mission, and so I led a team of students to select projects and meet with PIs to align with SEA's goal of carrying out student-run analog missions. I also help coordinate training for astronauts on the project SOPs and work with all the PIs to ensure that the projects go smoothly from submission to the mission to paper submission. Below are some of the stats of our 1st phase of project submissions.
