I have attended Gathering 4 Gardner since I was in middle school, a recreational math conference celebrating the life and work of Martin Gardner. I will be presenting a talk at Gathering 4 Gardner 16 in San Francisco, CA, in February 2026 about my multidisciplinary involvement with geodesic domes. Slides coming soon!
