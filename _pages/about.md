Welcome to my website! My CV is linked [here](https://sarakapasi.github.io/cv/) if you're here for that, and other ways to reach me are linked in the menu either to the left or above, depending on your screen resolution. Click the links at the top of the page to check out some of my other experiences and work!

What I do
------
I am a senior at Georgia Tech, majoring in Biomedical Engineering and minoring in Chemistry and Biochemistry. I'm interested in developing resilient delivery systems for microbes, drugs, and biologics in human health and harsh environments. At Tech, I work in the [Enveomics Lab](https://enve-omics.gatech.edu/people/) throughout the school year on mostly computational work, and for the past few summers I have worked in the [Appel Lab](https://www.supramolecularbiomaterials.com/) and the Traverso Lab as part of the [Stanford SURF program](https://engineering.stanford.edu/students-academics/equity-and-inclusion-initiatives/prospective-graduate-programs/summer) and the [MIT Summer Research Program (MSRP)](https://oge.mit.edu/msrp/profiles/sara-kapasi/), respectively. I was most recently, in the summer of 2025, a Product Engineering intern at Varda Space Industries [as part of the Brooke Owens Fellowship](https://www.brookeowensfellowship.org/sara-kapasi). 

I was formerly part of the Smart and Connected Bioelectronics VIP working on cardiovascular monitoring devices under [Dr. Woon-Hong Yeo](https://www.yeolabgatech.com/) from August 2022 to December 2023. Outside of classes, I served as one of the Biomedical Engineering officers for [Asclepios V](https://asclepios.ch/), a student-run analog mission based at EPFL, and was the Production Manager for [DramaTech](https://dramatech.org/), Georgia Tech's student-run theatre. I am currently Head of Research at [Southeast Analog (SEA)](https://southeastanalog.org/), one of the only student-run analog missions based in the US.

I do a variety of miscellaneous activities I think are cool, like participating in Gathering 4 Gardner, playing squash, running outside, and reading a book a week. I also hold an amateur radio license (KR4JRY)!

What I care about
------
My overarching goal in my work is to develop better ways of delivering better therapeutics. As someone surrounded by those with chronic diseases, I hope to be able to make a difference in my communities and use novel, innovative techniques to ensure a better quality of life. 

I am a strong supporter of interdisciplinary projects and am interested in supporting life in extreme environments, such as space. I believe that skills in engineering are translational throughout subfields, and I am happiest working on meaningful projects incorporating multiple disciplines, such as SEA and the Asclepios V mission. Since the start of my time in school, I've also been committed towards increasing diversity in STEM through my involvement in the Brooke Owens Fellowship, MSRP, and Stanford SURF, as well as Georgia Tech's [Undergraduate Research Ambassadors](https://urop.gatech.edu/content/undergraduate-research-ambassador-current), Women in Engineering program, and WST (Women, Science, and Technology) Living Learning Community.

How I got here
------
I've had the privilege of having teachers and friends passionate about STEM since middle school. In high school, I especially enjoyed [getting to be part of the Department of Energy's Science Bowl competitions](https://science.osti.gov/wdts/nsb/About/Historical-Information/2022-Competition/Team-Biographies/2022-Finals-High-School-Teams/The-Westminster-Schools) and learn a bit more about chemistry, biology, and how to read textbooks to learn about how the world works. I had some incredibly smart team members, yet I was consistently the only girl on the team. When I started  college, I wanted to work on hands-on projects with women and the LGBTQ+ community, and found myself developing an appreciation for working on technical theatre. Funny enough, skills needed for success in technical theatre also help out with research! I've always loved working with microorganisms and drugs and their applications to human health through my environmental background in chronic disease. After sending some emails and applications, I'm now here :)
