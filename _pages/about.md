What do/did I do?
------
I am currently a junior at Georgia Tech majoring in Biomedical Engineering and minoring in Chemistry and Biochemistry. At Tech, I work in the [Enveomics Lab](https://enve-omics.gatech.edu/) throughout the school year, and for the past few summers I have worked in the [Appel Lab](https://www.supramolecularbiomaterials.com/) and the Traverso Lab as part of the [Stanford SURF program](https://engineering.stanford.edu/students-academics/equity-and-inclusion-initiatives/prospective-graduate-programs/summer) and the [MIT Summer Research Program](https://oge.mit.edu/msrp/profiles/sara-kapasi/), respectively. 
I'm also a part of the M.A.R.S Vertically Integrated Projects (VIP) team starting January 2025, and was formerly part of the Smart and Connected Bioelectronics team working on cardiovascular monitoring devices under [Dr. Woon-Hong Yeo](https://www.yeolabgatech.com/) from August 2022 to December 2023. Outside of classes I serve as one of the Biomedical Engineering officers for [Asclepios V](https://asclepios.ch/), a student-run analog mission based at EPFL, and am Production Manager for [DramaTech](https://dramatech.org/), Georgia Tech's student-run theatre.

About this site
------
This website is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!
