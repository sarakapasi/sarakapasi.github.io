Welcome to my GT BMED notes page! 

why is this here?
------
sometimes you want to know what a course looks like before you take it! in my notes page for each course i provide the topics covered/how in-depth I think they're covered during the semester.

list of bmed courses:
------
- BMED 2110
- BMED 2400
- BMED 3100
- BMED 3410
- BMED 3520
- BMED 3600

oh no, i can't find X class that i would like notes for! 
------
send me an email and I'll see if I have the notes for it... some classes I have not included due to their nature as project-based classes.
