<h2>Welcome to my GT BMED notes page!</h2>

<h3>why is this here?</h3>
<p>sometimes you want to know what a course looks like before you take it! in my notes page for each course i provide the topics covered/how in-depth I think they're covered during the semester.
</p>

<h3>list of bmed courses:</h3>
<li>BMED 2110</li>
<li>BMED 2400</li>
<li>BMED 3100</li>
<li>BMED 3410</li>

<h3>oh no, i can't find X class that i would like notes for!</h3>
<p>send me an email and I'll see if I have the notes for it... some classes I have not included due to their nature as project-based classes.</p>
